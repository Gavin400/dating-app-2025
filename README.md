# Full-Stack Dating App (.NET + Angular)

This is a full-stack web application built as a long-term learning project over ~5 months.

The project was developed by following a structured course, but all code was
written, modified, debugged, and extended by me during the learning process.

## Why this project exists
The goal was to understand how a real-world application is built end-to-end:
- Backend API design
- Authentication & authorization
- Frontend architecture
- Real-time features
- Deployment

## What I implemented
- ASP.NET Core Web API with JWT authentication
- Angular SPA with protected routes
- Entity Framework Core with migrations
- Real-time messaging using SignalR
- Photo upload & gallery
- Paging, sorting, filtering
- Azure deployment

## My own additions / changes
- Refactored authentication flow
- Improved error handling in API & UI
- Custom UI styling with Tailwind & DaisyUI
- Fixed multiple SignalR edge cases
- Improved Angular form validation
